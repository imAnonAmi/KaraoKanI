# Project One Description

Our project is an application that utilizes a user provided song name, which is then called against the MusixMatch API to generate a list of the artist(s) associated with this song. The user can then interact with this list to view further artist information via the Wikipedia API, as well as the song lyrics via another MusixMatch API call.


## Application layout (see Wireframe.jpg)
Our application consists of an input field and submit button at the top of the application. Upon submitting a song name, the associated artist(s) will be listed on the left hand side of the screen. When an artist is selected, additional information about the selected artist will replace the list of artists on the left hand side(toggle), and the lyrics for the song will be displayed on the right hand side of the screen.
